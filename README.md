So that I can visit my bookmarked web pages
I want to see a list of links

As a user, so that I can remember cool new websites I find,
I want to be able to add new bookmarks

As a user, so that itâ€™s easy to sort through my links later,
I want to be able to add tags to each link

As a user, so that I can retrieve links from a specific category,
I want to be able to filter my links by their tags
